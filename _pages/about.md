Weinan Shi is an assistant researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. He received his bachelor's and doctorate degrees from Tsinghua University in 2016 and 2021. His research focuses on intelligent human-computer interaction, including text entry, context-aware technology, wearable devices, and accessibility. He proposed a Bayesian model of finger movement control ability, which has been used as a critical feature in the Sogou input method. This method now benefits over 600 million users, facilitating the input of approximately 90 billion words daily, and has markedly enhanced recall and correction click rate. He also proposed the world's first smart keyboard for visually impaired people, significantly reducing the input error rate. He won the ACM CHI Honorable Mention Award and the first prize in the China Human-Factors Engineering Design Competition.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CngLjRkAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CngLjRkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
